      <description>Bookrotate is an app that allows people to swap books. It will be the digital library of the actual books people have and will let them swap books. The project is still in progress. It will soon be ready. Contact me if you want to contribute or have some ideas or experiences to share!</description>

      <description>When I first saw itertools, I was thinking why anyone would ever need that? However, after using itertools, I can&amp;rsquo;t really think why we should use something else in Python when it comes to data.
I learned about itertools from Joel Grus in one of his Pydata Talks, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked it out yet, I strongly encourage you to check it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThS4juptJjQ
Itertools is a beautiful library that allows lazy computation / evaluation in python and it has got methods such as:</description>

      <description>As the title says it all, this post is on how to perform weighted average in SQL, which is not supported natively, by exploiting some math and window functions in a cunning üòà yet logical way ü§ì than trying to pull out a physical solution.
In normal data engineering, this approach should be avoided at all costs as it will can be super hard to maintain but nevertheless this is a very useful trick for quick data analysis.</description>
