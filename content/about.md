Hey, welcome to my blog!

I am a data engineer based in Berlin. 
I would like to share my passion for data, programming, machine learning and technology in this blog!


I like going to nature, biking, reading, and practicing martial arts and yoga.

I am a big fan of audiobooks \& also might be the biggest tea junkie in the world!
