Hey, welcome to my blog!

I am a software and data engineer based in Berlin. 
I intend to write about programming, data, technology and also some life stuff here in this blog!


I like going to nature, biking, reading, and practicing martial arts and yoga.

I am a big fan of audiobooks \& also might be the biggest tea junkie 🍵 in the world!
